# Code Buddy

_Your daily dose of LeetCode can be tedious, but you don't have to do it alone! Code Buddy allows you to share your experience with friends and strangers_.

Code Buddy is a Google Chrome extension designed to connect up to 4 people working on the same LeetCode problem together.
Using the extension, we hope that you will have fun while doing LeetCode, while also having someone to keep you accountable ðŸ’ª.

We would like to acknowledge `binarysearch.com` (which unfortunately no longer exist) for the inspiration and [LeetRoom](https://leetrooms.com/) for the initial execution.

## Features

- Live streaming code and test cases
- Integration with Leetcode problems

## Notes

Code Buddy is still under active development. If your live stream get stuck, try refreshing your browser.
